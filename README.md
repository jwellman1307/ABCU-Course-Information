# ABCU Course Information System

## Overview
The ABCU Course Information System is a C++ console application designed to efficiently store, sort, and retrieve course information from a CSV file. The project demonstrates the practical application of data structures to solve real-world data organization and retrieval problems.

The system reads course data, organizes it using a Binary Search Tree (BST), and allows users to view course listings in alphanumeric order or retrieve detailed information for a specific course.

## Features
- Import course data from a CSV file
- Store course information using a Binary Search Tree
- Display all courses in alphanumeric order
- Retrieve and display individual course details
- Efficient search and memory usage through data structure selection

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **CSV File Processing**
- **Visual Studio**
- **Object-Oriented Programming Principles**

## Design Decisions
Multiple data structures were evaluated during development, including vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. A Binary Search Tree was selected due to its ability to maintain sorted order while supporting efficient insertion and search operations.

This design choice allows the application to:
- Display courses in natural alphanumeric order
- Scale effectively as the dataset grows
- Maintain clean and predictable performance characteristics

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Practical use of data structures in C++
- Algorithmic thinking and performance tradeoff analysis
- File input processing and data validation
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code organization
- Real-world problem solving using foundational CS concepts
