# ABCU-Course-Information

In this course, I learned about different types of data structures and how to apply them to base python code in eclipse. The project consisted of creating a data structure that could alphanumberize a list of courses taken from a CSV file to display to the user as course information. I approached this problem by analyzing three data stuctures that included a vector, hash, and binary search tree. Data structures are importantnt to understand becuase each data structure has a use depending on the client's needs. In this project, I went with a binary search tree due to that BST are already alphanumerize. Roadblocks that I ran into were how to start the original code and add to an alreacy existing base code. I was able to get over this roadblock by starting with the pseudocode while anaylzing the code prior to any adjustments made to the code. The work done on project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by understanding that memory usage and choice of data structures can effect the overall program and must be considered as part of the design. My work in this project has evolved in the way that I write programs by allowing me discover what way works best for me analyze and understand code.
